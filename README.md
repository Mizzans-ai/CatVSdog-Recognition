Frontal Face Detection Using OpenCV
This project implements a frontal face detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The model identifies faces in an image and highlights them with bounding boxes.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect frontal faces in images using a pre-trained Haar Cascade model provided by OpenCV. This can be extended for real-time applications like surveillance or face recognition systems.

Features
Face Detection: Detects frontal faces in still images.
Image Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Simple Workflow: Easy-to-follow steps for setup and usage.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
OpenCV (opencv-python, opencv-python-headless)
NumPy (optional for advanced operations)
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy
Dataset
The detection is performed on a single image file. You can use the included example or replace it with your own image by updating the image_path in the code.

python
Copy code
image_path = "C:/path_to_your_image.jpg"
How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FrontalFaceDetection.git
cd FrontalFaceDetection
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "Frontal Face Detection.ipynb"
Follow the instructions:

Update the image_path variable to your image location.
Run the notebook cells step by step.
View Results: The program will display the input image with bounding boxes drawn around detected faces.

Model and Approach
Haar Cascade Classifier: A pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is used for frontal face detection. This model is lightweight and effective for detecting faces under standard conditions.
Example Output
When a face is detected, the output image will have bounding boxes drawn around the detected faces.

(Replace this with your actual output image)

Limitations
May not perform well on non-frontal or obscured faces.
Sensitive to lighting and image quality.
Future Enhancements
Extend to detect multiple facial features (eyes, nose, mouth).
Integrate with real-time video feeds using OpenCV.
